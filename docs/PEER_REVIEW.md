## Summary

The project demonstrates strong engineering foundations: structured logging, context propagation, table-driven tests, atomic state management, and an Erlang-style supervisor tree. The internal packages are well-tested (85–94% coverage). However, the review identified **48 discrete issues** across five severity tiers (plus 5 CI/CD issues introduced at review time), including critical concurrency bugs and a logic error in the lock subsystem that will cause lock theft for any stream running longer than five minutes — the primary operational scenario.

---

## Severity Definitions

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | Will cause incorrect runtime behavior or data corruption |
| **MAJOR** | Significant defect or security concern; blocks production release |
| **MEDIUM** | Functional defect or design violation with workaround |
| **LOW** | Code quality, style, or minor inconsistency |
| **DOC** | Documentation inaccuracy or omission |

## CRITICAL Issues

### C-1 — Lock Theft for Long-Running Streams

**File:** `internal/lock/filelock.go:296–347`
**Function:** `isLockStale`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

The stale-lock check considered a lock **stale if the lock file's `ModTime` is older than `DefaultStaleThreshold` (300 s), even when the process that owned the lock was confirmed to be running** (signal 0 succeeded). The check ran signal-0 to verify the process was alive, and then fell through to the age check regardless:

```go
// ORIGINAL BUGGY CODE:
err = process.Signal(syscall.Signal(0))
if err != nil {
    return true, nil  // process dead → stale (correct)
}
// Age check ran even when the process was alive:
age := time.Since(info.ModTime())
if age > threshold {
    return true, nil  // WRONG: running process treated as stale
}
```

**Fix applied:** `isLockStale` now returns `false` immediately when `signal(0)` succeeds (process alive). The age check is not run for live processes. Regression test `TestFileLockStaleOldAgeAliveProcess` added; `TestFileLockStaleDeadProcessOldAge` documents the correct stale path.

---

### C-2 — Data Race: `registeredServices` Map Accessed from Multiple Goroutines

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go:130–274`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

`registeredServices` was a plain `map[string]bool` written and read from three goroutines concurrently (poll loop, SIGHUP handler, main goroutine).

**Fix applied:** The map is now protected by `sync.RWMutex` (`registeredMu`). Read operations use `RLock`/`RUnlock`; write operations use `Lock`/`Unlock`. The reload goroutine's range loop (L-14) was also fixed to copy names under `RLock` before iterating.

---

### C-3 — Nil Pointer Dereference: `koanfCfg` Can Be Nil

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go:221`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

`loadConfigurationKoanf` returned `(nil, config.DefaultConfig(), nil)` when the config file was absent and `NewKoanfConfig` failed. The poll loop called `koanfCfg.Load()` unconditionally, causing a nil pointer dereference.

**Fix applied:** The poll loop now guards `koanfCfg` with a nil check and falls back to the previously loaded `cfg` when `koanfCfg` is nil. The SIGHUP handler also guards with a nil check and treats it as a no-op. Regression test `TestLoadConfigurationKoanfNonNilOnSuccess` added.

---

### C-4 — Race Condition in `serviceWrapper.Serve` / `Stop`

**File:** `internal/supervisor/supervisor.go:161–208`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

`serviceWrapper` stored `ctx` and `cancel` as plain fields set by `Serve()` and read by `Stop()` with no synchronization. If suture called `Stop()` between `Serve()` entry and `w.cancel` assignment, the service would not be stopped.

**Fix applied:** Added `sync.Mutex mu` to `serviceWrapper`. `Serve()` sets `w.cancel` under `mu.Lock()`; `Stop()` reads `w.cancel` under `mu.Lock()`. The `ctx` field was removed from the struct (it was only used as a local variable inside `Serve`). `Remove()` now delegates to `Stop()` so the mutex is always respected. Stress tests `TestSupervisor_StopServeCancelRace` and `TestSupervisor_StopCoverage` added.

---

### C-5 — `m.cmd` Assigned Before `cmd.Start()` Succeeds

**File:** `internal/stream/manager.go:487–497`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

`m.cmd` was assigned before `cmd.Start()`, so a failed start left a dangling pointer to an unstarted command. A concurrent `stop()` call could then attempt to signal a nil `Process`.

**Fix applied:** `m.cmd` is now assigned only after `cmd.Start()` returns `nil`. The lock/unlock is split: pre-start (logWriter, startTime), start, then post-start (m.cmd). Regression test `TestStartFFmpegCmdNilOnFailure` added.

---

## MAJOR Issues

### M-1 — Error Comparison Using `==` Instead of `errors.Is`

**Files:**
- `internal/stream/manager.go:290` — `if err == context.Canceled`
- `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go:279` — `err != context.Canceled`
- `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go:300` — `err != context.Canceled`

**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

**Fix applied:** All three sites now use `errors.Is(err, context.Canceled)`.

---

### M-2 — Watchdog Signal Never Sent (`WatchdogSec` Without `sd_notify`)

**File:** `systemd/lyrebird-stream.service:67`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

The service file set `WatchdogSec=60` but the daemon never calls `sd_notify(0, "WATCHDOG=1")`. systemd would kill and restart the service every 60 seconds on any system with watchdog enforcement active.

**Fix applied:** `WatchdogSec=60` removed. A comment explains the absence: the daemon does not implement sd_notify keepalives.

---

### M-3 — Health Endpoint Is Implemented But Never Started

**Files:** `internal/health/health.go`, `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

`internal/health` provided `ListenAndServe` and a complete `Handler` but the daemon never started it.

**Fix applied:** The daemon now starts `health.ListenAndServe(ctx, ":9998", healthHandler)` in a goroutine before the supervisor loop. Health check failures are logged as warnings (non-fatal).

---

### M-4 — Device Polling Only Triggers When No Services Are Registered

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go:219`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

The poll loop was gated on `sup.ServiceCount() == 0`, so a second USB microphone plugged in after startup was never registered.

**Fix applied:** The `ServiceCount() == 0` gate removed. The poll loop now scans unconditionally on every tick, calling `registerDevices` which skips already-registered devices via the mutex-protected map.

---

### M-5 — `Manager.Close()` Never Called; Log File Handles Leak

**Files:** `internal/stream/manager.go:417`, `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go:297–305`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

`streamService.Run()` called `m.manager.Run(ctx)` but never called `m.manager.Close()`. Every supervisor-initiated restart accumulated an open log file handle.

**Fix applied:** `streamService.Run()` now calls `s.manager.Close()` with error logging immediately after `s.manager.Run(ctx)` returns, regardless of the run result.

---

### M-6 — Config Changes on SIGHUP Not Applied to Running Streams

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go:134–198`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Each registered device now has a stable hash of its `ManagerConfig` (sample rate, channels, bitrate, codec, thread queue, RTSP URL) stored in `registeredConfigHashes`. On SIGHUP the handler compares the new config hash against the stored hash for every registered device. If the hash differs, `sup.Remove(devName)` stops the old stream, the device is deleted from both maps, and `registerDevices(newCfg)` re-registers it with the updated parameters. Only changed devices are restarted; unchanged streams continue uninterrupted.

---

### M-7 — Misleading `isLockStale` Comment on Age Check

**File:** `internal/lock/filelock.go:339–343`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

**Fix applied:** Comments updated as part of the C-1 fix. `isLockStale` now documents that the age check was removed from the live-process path and explains why (`signal(0)` success is authoritative).

---

### M-8 — `koanf.go` env Transform Comment Is Misleading

**File:** `internal/config/koanf.go:152–154`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

The comment claimed prefix removal was "already handled by Prefix option." It is not — the `TrimPrefix` call is necessary.

**Fix applied:** Comment replaced with accurate description: "k arrives WITHOUT the LYREBIRD_ prefix (stripped by env.Provider)."

---

### M-9 — `Watch()` Does Not Stop the File Watcher on Context Cancellation

**File:** `internal/config/koanf.go:239–271`
**Status: ✅ DOCUMENTED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

`fp.Watch(...)` starts an internal `fsnotify` goroutine that cannot be stopped because koanf v2's `file.Provider` exposes no `Stop()` method. The goroutine leak is a real defect in the koanf dependency.

**Fix applied:** The goroutine leak cannot be fixed without a koanf API change. A detailed doc comment now explains the limitation and recommends using manual `Reload()` calls on SIGHUP instead of `Watch()`. The daemon uses the SIGHUP approach. The daemon does **not** call `Watch()`.

---

### M-10 — `runDetect` Outputs Hardcoded Settings, Ignores Actual Device Capabilities

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird/main.go:218–246` (`runDetectWithPath`)
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** `runDetectWithPath` now calls `audio.DetectCapabilities(asoundPath, dev)` for each detected device and uses the returned `Capabilities` struct (supported sample rates, channel counts, formats, recommended settings) to print per-device recommendations. The injected `asoundPath` parameter enables unit testing without real hardware. Tests added with a mock `/proc/asound` fixture.

---

### M-11 — `allPassed` Logic Broken in `runTest`

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird/main.go:1152` (`runTest`)
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Every test that previously returned early or printed a warning without updating `allPassed` now sets `allPassed = false`. The final "All tests passed!" message is gated on `allPassed` being true throughout all test steps. Tests added for the warning-level failure paths.

---

### M-12 — `installLyreBirdService` Writes a Stripped-Down Service File

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird/main.go:910` (`installLyreBirdService`)
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** `installLyreBirdService` now writes a service file whose content matches `systemd/lyrebird-stream.service` exactly, including all security hardening directives (`ProtectSystem=strict`, `NoNewPrivileges=true`, `CapabilityBoundingSet`, `PrivateTmp`, etc.). A test verifies the installed content contains the critical security directives.

---

### M-13 — Self-Update Has No Checksum Verification

**File:** `internal/updater/updater.go:266` (`Download`)
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** `Download` now fetches `checksums.txt` from the same release, parses the SHA256 entry for the target binary filename, and verifies the downloaded binary before installation. If the checksum does not match, the download is discarded and an error is returned. Tests added covering checksum match, mismatch, missing entry, and malformed file.

---

## MEDIUM Issues

### ME-1 — `Backoff.RecordFailure` Doubles Delay on First Call

**File:** `internal/stream/backoff.go:90–103`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

At construction, `currentDelay = initialDelay`. `RecordFailure()` doubled it immediately, so the first restart waited `2 × initialDelay` (20 s) rather than the documented `initialDelay` (10 s).

**Fix applied:** The call order in `manager.Run()` was swapped: `WaitContext()` is called first (using the current, pre-doubled delay), then `RecordFailure()` doubles the delay for the *next* iteration. The `Backoff` library itself was not changed. Regression test `TestBackoffFirstRestartUsesInitialDelay` added.

---

### ME-2 — `logf` Always Uses `Info` Level and Loses Structured Logging Benefits

**Files:** `internal/stream/manager.go:214–217`, `internal/supervisor/supervisor.go:250–253`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

Both `logf` wrappers called `logger.Info(...)` for all messages including errors.

**Fix applied:** `Manager` now has both `logf` (Info) and `logError` (Error). Failure paths in `Run()` use `logError`. See also ME-7.

---

### ME-3 — `stop()` Spawns an Unkillable 2-Second Goroutine

**File:** `internal/stream/manager.go:564–570`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

The kill goroutine used `time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)` with no cancellation mechanism, potentially overlapping with a new process's lifecycle under high restart frequency.

**Fix applied:** The goroutine now uses `context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)`. The goroutine waits on `<-killCtx.Done()` and only kills when `killCtx.Err() == context.DeadlineExceeded` (i.e., FFmpeg did not exit within 2 s on its own). `killCancel()` is deferred so the context is always released.

---

### ME-4 — `findDeviceIDPath` Hardcodes `/dev/snd/by-id`, Untestable

**File:** `internal/audio/detector.go:226–258`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Renamed to `findDeviceIDPathIn(byIDDir string, cardNumber int) string`; added `getDeviceInfo(asoundPath, cardNumber, byIDDir)` internal function. The public `GetDeviceInfo` calls it with `/dev/snd/by-id`. Tests use `t.TempDir()` with `os.Symlink` to exercise the path without real hardware. Coverage improved from 27.8% to 97.6%.

---

### ME-5 — `udev.WriteRulesFile` and `udev.ReloadUdevRules` Have 0% Coverage

**File:** `internal/udev/rules.go:167, 217`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Added `cmdRunner` function type (`func(name string, args ...string) ([]byte, error)`), `reloadUdevRulesWith(runner)`, and `writeRulesFileToPathWithRunner`. Public functions delegate to injectable variants with `defaultCmdRunner`. Tests cover success, first-command failure, second-command failure, and reload=false skip. Coverage improved from 0% to 92.9%.

---

### ME-6 — `config.Save()` Coverage Is 68%; Atomic-Write Error Paths Untested

**File:** `internal/config/config.go:116` (`Save`)
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Introduced `atomicFile` interface and `atomicCreateTemp` function type. `Save` delegates to `saveWith(path, defaultCreateTemp)`; tests inject a `mockAtomicFile` with controllable `writeErr`, `syncErr`, `chmodErr`, `closeErr`. All five error branches (createTemp, Write, Sync, Chmod, Close) are now covered. `Save` coverage increased from 68% to 100%.

---

### ME-7 — `logf` in `supervisor.go` Uses `fmt.Sprintf` Then `slog.Info`

**File:** `internal/supervisor/supervisor.go:250–253`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

Same structural anti-pattern as ME-2.

**Fix applied:** `Supervisor` now has `logf` (Info), `logWarn` (Warn), and `logError` (Error) helpers. Service failure paths use `logWarn`; the suture-remove error path uses `logWarn`. The "Warning:" string prefix in the remove log message was also removed (it is now expressed via the log level).

---

### ME-8 — Package-Level Flag Variables Impede Testability

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go:60–65`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** All daemon logic extracted into `runDaemon(flags daemonFlags) int` which returns an exit code. `main()` parses flags and calls `runDaemon`. Tests call `runDaemon(daemonFlags{...})` directly without touching `flag.Parse()`. Added `TestDaemonFlagsStruct`, `TestRunDaemonLockDirError`, `TestRunDaemonFFmpegNotFound`.

---

### ME-9 — `internal/health` HTTP Server Missing `ReadTimeout` and `WriteTimeout`

**File:** `internal/health/health.go:92–96`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

Without `ReadTimeout` and `WriteTimeout`, the health server was vulnerable to slow-client (Slowloris) connections.

**Fix applied:** `ReadTimeout: 10 * time.Second` and `WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second` added to the `http.Server` struct.

---

### ME-10 — env Transform Is Brittle: New `DeviceConfig` Fields Break env Overrides

**File:** `internal/config/koanf.go:176–186`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Replaced hardcoded `knownFields` slice with `deviceConfigFieldSuffixes`, a package-level var computed at init time by `buildDeviceConfigFieldSuffixes()` using reflection over `DeviceConfig` struct tags (`koanf`, fallback `yaml`). New fields are automatically included. Tests verify the reflection matches expected fields and that env overrides apply correctly.

---

### ME-11 — `ValidatePartial` Allows `SampleRate < 0` to Pass

**File:** `internal/config/config.go:276`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** `ValidatePartial` now rejects `SampleRate < 0` and `Channels < 0` with the message "must not be negative (0 means inherit default)", accurately reflecting that 0 is a valid unset sentinel and only negative values are invalid. Tests updated to match the new message.

---

### ME-12 — `getUSBBusDevFromCard` Has 16% Coverage and Fragile Loop Logic

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird/main.go:360` (`getUSBBusDevFromCard`)
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Added `getUSBBusDevFromCardWithSysRoot(cardNum, sysRoot)` injectable variant. Fixed the infinite-loop bug: the old `continue` inside the busnum `if` block jumped back to the outer `for` without advancing `devicePath`, causing an infinite loop on malformed busnum content. Replaced with explicit parent-walk logic and local variable resets before each parse attempt. Tests added including a "malformed busnum does not infinite loop" sub-test with a timeout.

---

## LOW Issues

### L-1 — `supervisor.serviceWrapper.Stop()` Had 0% Coverage

**File:** `internal/supervisor/supervisor.go:204`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

**Fix applied:** `TestSupervisor_StopCoverage` calls `Remove()` while a service is running, which causes suture to call `Stop()` on the wrapper. Coverage now exercised under the race detector.

---

### L-2 — `Manager.Close()` Has 0% Unit Test Coverage

**File:** `internal/stream/manager.go:417`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Added `TestManagerClose` with four sub-tests: nil logWriter (no-op), idempotent double-close, logWriter closed and nilled, and error from `logWriter.Close()` propagated correctly. Uses a `failingCloseWriter` mock struct.

---

### L-3 — `menu.RunCommand` Has 0% Coverage

**File:** `internal/menu/menu.go:409`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/close-peer-review-issues-96S8h`

**Fix applied:** Added `TestRunCommand` (success with `echo`), `TestRunCommandFailure` (non-zero exit via `false`), and `TestRunCommandNotFound` (missing binary). `RunCommand` coverage: 0% → 100%.

---

### L-4 — `downloadFile` and `installLyreBirdService` Have 0% Coverage

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird/main.go:1091, 910`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/close-peer-review-issues-96S8h`

**Fix applied:** Added seven new tests using PATH injection (fake `curl`/`wget`/`systemctl` shell scripts in `t.TempDir()`): `TestDownloadFileNeitherFound`, `TestDownloadFileCurlSuccess`, `TestDownloadFileCurlFailure`, `TestDownloadFileWgetSuccess`, `TestDownloadFileWgetFailure`, `TestInstallLyreBirdServiceToPathSuccess`, `TestInstallLyreBirdServiceToPathWriteError`, `TestInstallLyreBirdServiceToPathSystemctlFailure`. `downloadFile` coverage: 36.4% → 100%; `installLyreBirdServiceToPath` coverage: 0% → 100%. The thin `installLyreBirdService()` wrapper (which writes to `/etc/systemd/system/`) remains untestable without root.

---

### L-5 — `menu.Display` Has 5.6% Coverage; `createDeviceMenu` 36.4%

**File:** `internal/menu/menu.go:104, 492`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/close-peer-review-issues-96S8h`

**Fix applied:** Added `TestDisplayHuhPathEmptyOptions` (calls `Display()` with `m.input == os.Stdin` and all-hidden items, hitting the `len(options)==0` early-return in the huh branch — no TTY required), `TestDisplayAllHiddenScanner`, `TestDisplayWithScannerSubMenu`, and structure tests for all four sub-menu factories (`TestCreateDeviceMenuStructure`, `TestCreateStreamMenuStructure`, `TestCreateDiagnosticsMenuStructure`, `TestCreateConfigMenuStructure`). `Display()` coverage: 5.6% → 33.3%; overall menu package: 55.6% → 61.5%.

---

### L-6 — `SafeGoWithRecover` Closes Channel After Sending Error

**File:** `internal/util/panic.go:88–96`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** The channel is now always closed in a `defer`, regardless of the error path. This removes the ambiguity: callers using `range` always see the channel close as the termination signal, and the error (if any) is received before the close. Tests verify that both the error value and the channel close are observable.

---

### L-7 — `stop()` Undocumented Intentional Signal Discard

**File:** `internal/stream/manager.go:560`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

**Fix applied:** Comment added explaining that `ESRCH` is the expected benign race when the process exits between the nil-check and the signal call.

---

### L-8 — Makefile `test` Timeout (30 s) Diverges from CI Timeout (2 min)

**File:** `Makefile:83`, `ci.yml:106`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

**Fix applied:** Makefile `test` and `test-race` targets updated to `-timeout 2m`.

---

### L-9 — `golangci-lint` Version Mismatch Between CI and Makefile

**File:** `ci.yml:49`, `Makefile:119`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/close-peer-review-issues-96S8h`

**Fix applied:** `Makefile` `lint` target changed from `golangci-lint@latest` to `golangci-lint@v1.62.2` (matching CI). `dev` target also pinned to `v1.62.2` (and `gosec@v2.21.4` to match CI). Local `make lint` and `make dev` now install the same pinned version as GitHub Actions.

---

### L-10 — `go.mod` Contains Two YAML Parsers

**File:** `go.mod:9,52`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/close-peer-review-issues-96S8h`

**Fix applied:** `internal/config/config.go` and `internal/config/backup.go` migrated from `"gopkg.in/yaml.v3"` to `"go.yaml.in/yaml/v3"`. The two packages expose identical `Marshal`/`Unmarshal` APIs. After `go mod tidy`, `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` is completely removed from `go.mod`; only `go.yaml.in/yaml/v3 v3.0.4` remains (now as a direct dependency). All `internal/config` tests continue to pass.

---

### L-11 — `stretchr/testify` Listed as Indirect Dependency

**File:** `go.mod:50`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/close-peer-review-issues-96S8h`

**Fix applied:** `github.com/stretchr/testify v1.11.1` was explicitly pinned in `go.mod` via a prior `go get` even though no `.go` file imports testify directly. `go mod edit -droprequire` removed the explicit pin; `go mod tidy` confirmed testify v1.8.4 is now resolved transiently from koanf without needing an explicit entry. All tests pass with the version selected by MVS.

---

### L-12 — `logrotate.go` Feature Not Wired in Daemon

**File:** `internal/stream/logrotate.go`, `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Added `--log-dir` flag (default `/var/log/lyrebird`). `runDaemon` creates the directory with `MkdirAll` and falls back to empty (discard) on failure. `flags.LogDir` is wired into `mgrCfg.LogDir` in the `registerDevices` closure, activating `RotatingWriter` for FFmpeg stderr when the directory is set.

---

### L-13 — Platform Build Constraints Missing

**Files:** `internal/lock/filelock.go`, `internal/diagnostics/diagnostics.go`, `internal/stream/monitor.go`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied (Phase 1):** `//go:build linux` added to `internal/lock/filelock.go` and its test file, and to `internal/diagnostics/diagnostics.go` and its test file.

**Fix applied (Phase 2):** `//go:build linux` added to `internal/stream/monitor.go` and `internal/stream/monitor_test.go`. All three files now carry correct platform constraints.

---

### L-14 — `registeredServices` Read Without Lock in Reload Goroutine (Logging)

**File:** `cmd/lyrebird-stream/main.go:262–269`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

Fixed as part of the C-2 fix. The reload goroutine now copies names into a local slice under `registeredMu.RLock()` before iterating.

---

## Documentation Issues

### D-1 — README: Migration Timeline Is Stale

**File:** `README.md:239`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Removed the specific "(estimated: Q2 2025)" date from the migration timeline statement.

---

### D-2 — README: "No Runtime Dependencies" Is Inaccurate

**File:** `README.md:21`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Changed to "no shared library dependencies (requires ffmpeg, udevadm, systemctl at runtime)".

---

### D-3 — README: Integration Tests Claim Is Inaccurate

**File:** `README.md:344`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Changed to "Integration tests (ubuntu-latest; hardware-specific paths are skipped in CI)".

---

### D-4 — CLAUDE.md: "Future Work" Section Is Outdated

**File:** `CLAUDE.md` — "Future Work / Remaining"
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-peer-review-fixes-lQ6hO`

**Fix applied:** CLAUDE.md updated to move SIGHUP hot-reload to the Completed section and document all peer-review fixes implemented in this session.

---

### D-5 — CLAUDE.md: Code Example Omits Error Handling

**File:** `CLAUDE.md` — koanf example
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Added `if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }` after `cfg, err := kc.Load()` in the example.

---

### D-6 — Developer Artifacts at Repository Root

**Files:** `AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `FINDINGS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** All five planning/audit documents (including `PEER_REVIEW.md`) moved to `docs/`. Repository root now contains only `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

---

### D-7 — AUDIT_REPORT.md Contains Inaccurate Bug Descriptions

**File:** `AUDIT_REPORT.md:30–43`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Updated sections 1.1 and 1.2 in `docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md` to accurately describe that both were investigated and found not to be bugs: (1) `state.Load()` is always initialised in the constructor, (2) `Backoff.Reset` acquires a mutex before field access and is always called with a non-nil receiver.

---

### D-8 — README: Performance Numbers Are Duplicated

**File:** `README.md:413–433`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Merged the duplicate figures into the "Resource Usage" section; "Benchmarks" section now only contains the `make bench` command and startup/init timing that was unique to it.

---

### D-9 — CLAUDE.md Coverage Table Formatting Is Inconsistent

**File:** `CLAUDE.md` — "Current Test Coverage" table
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Column widths in the Markdown table aligned consistently with uniform padding.

---

### D-10 — README `Debug Mode` Section Is Misleading

**File:** `README.md:395`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Replaced `sudo -E systemctl restart` (which does not inject env vars into systemd units) with the correct `EnvironmentFile`-based approach: add the variable to `/etc/lyrebird/environment`, then `sudo systemctl restart lyrebird-stream`.

---

## CI/CD Issues

### CI-1 — CI Tests Only One Go Version

**File:** `ci.yml:85`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/close-peer-review-issues-96S8h`

**Fix applied:** Test matrix extended to `['1.24.2', '1.24.13']` — the minimum version from `go.mod` (`go 1.24.2`) and the latest stable. Both versions are tested on every push/PR.

---

### CI-2 — Release Job Does Not Create a GitHub Release

**File:** `ci.yml:233–266`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/close-peer-review-issues-96S8h`

**Fix applied:** Added `permissions: contents: write` to the `release` job, a `Checkout code` step (required for `gh` to resolve the token), and a `Create GitHub Release` step using `gh release create "${{ github.ref_name }}" --generate-notes bin/lyrebird-* bin/checksums.txt`. Tag pushes now produce a real GitHub Release with all cross-compiled binaries and checksums attached.

---

### CI-3 — `codecov/codecov-action` Uses `v4` Without SHA Pin

**File:** `ci.yml:111`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/close-peer-review-issues-96S8h`

**Fix applied:** `codecov/codecov-action@v4` replaced with `codecov/codecov-action@b9fd7d16f6d7d1b5d2bec1a2887e65ceed900238` (v4.6.0 commit SHA). A `# v4.6.0` comment is kept for human readability. The tag cannot be silently moved against this pin.

---

### CI-4 — `gosec` and `govulncheck` Installed at `@latest`

**File:** `ci.yml:69, 76`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/implement-lyrebirdaudio-go-joVPr`

**Fix applied:** Pinned to `gosec@v2.21.4` and `govulncheck@v1.1.3`.

---

### CI-5 — Integration Test Step Runs on `ubuntu-latest` Without Hardware

**File:** `ci.yml:212`
**Status: ✅ FIXED** — `claude/close-peer-review-issues-96S8h`

**Fix applied:** A `Hardware-requirement notice` step (runs with `if: always()`) is appended after the integration test step. It clearly states that ubuntu-latest has no USB audio hardware and that hardware-gated tests are expected to be skipped via `t.Skip()` / build constraints. The comment on the `Run integration tests` step is updated to describe the real purpose: verifying that integration-tagged code compiles cleanly and hardware-specific code paths are properly guarded. Full hardware testing requires a self-hosted runner.

## Positive Observations

The following aspects are well-executed and should be preserved:

- **`internal/audio/capabilities.go`** — `DetectCapabilities` is 100% covered and correctly models PCM capabilities with recommended settings logic.
- **`internal/stream/manager.go:179–211`** — `NewManager` constructor correctly initializes `state.Store(StateIdle)` and guards all resource setup.
- **`internal/config/config.go:116–172`** — `Save()` uses atomic temp-file-then-rename pattern correctly with explicit `Sync()` before rename.
- **`internal/udev/rules.go`** — `GenerateRule` and `GenerateRulesFile` are 100% covered with byte-for-byte bash-compatibility tests. This is exactly the right approach.
- **`internal/supervisor/supervisor.go`** — The suture integration, `serviceEntry` lifecycle tracking, and `Status()` API are clean and well-structured.
- **`internal/stream/backoff.go`** — The nil-receiver safety pattern (`if b == nil { return }`) is consistently applied throughout the API.
- **`internal/lock/filelock.go:167–237`** — `AcquireContext` uses a ticker + select pattern correctly for context-aware blocking.
- **`internal/config/backup.go`** — Atomic backup with timestamp naming and rotation cleanup is well-designed.
- **All packages use `t.TempDir()`** for file-system tests — no leftover temp files in CI.
- **`internal/util/panic.go`** — `SafeGo` and `SafeGoWithRecover` are 100% covered with full panic recovery tests including stack capture.
